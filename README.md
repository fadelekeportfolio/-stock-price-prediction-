Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies **LSTM**, **XGBoost**, and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** to forecast stock prices using historical market data. It demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, time series modeling**, and **model performance evaluation**.

Through exploratory data analysis, model tuning, and performance comparison, the project highlights how traditional ML and deep learning models can uncover trends and improve prediction accuracy.

**Key Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Key Skills:** Data Cleaning, Feature Scaling, GridSearchCV, Model Optimization, Evaluation Metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)

This analysis reflects the ability to turn complex financial data into actionable insights — a critical skill for **data-driven roles in finance, analytics, and forecasting**.
